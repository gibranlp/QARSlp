# QARSlp Qtile + Arch Ricing Script

This is a custom theme for the [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org/) window manager that dynamically adapts to the colors generated by [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal). With this theme, you can easily change the appearance of your Qtile environment to match any image or wallpaper using pywal's color extraction and manipulation capabilities.

This config files provide a few minimal and clean look themes, with a focus on simplicity and usability. 

It features a dark & light color schemes with contrasting colors for active and inactive windows, as well as customizable font sizes and styles.

Then run the copy_files.sh script to generate all the folders and copy all the necesary files.

Finally in a terminal run:

This will generate the first palette of colors and set the wallpaper, the path of the wallpaper is ~/Pictures/Wallpapers, just put all your wallpapers inside and enjoy.
